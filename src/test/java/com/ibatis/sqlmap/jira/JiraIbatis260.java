/*
 * Regression test for JIRA IBATIS-260: "Hash conflict with groupBy
 * resultMaps".
 * <p/>
 * The JIRA was about a problem using groupBy in a hierarchy (look in the SqlMap
 * of this test case for an example). The problem was that when a value of a
 * groupBy key for the second level groupBy existed in more than 1 first level
 * groupBy some objects would be assigned to the wrong 2nd level group.
 * <p/>
 * The reason for this was that the values of the keys of the groupBys would only
 * take into account the current groupBy level. The fix is to keep track of all
 * of the values for the keys used in previous groupBys in the hierarchy so that
 * the objects can be properly assigned.
 * <p/>
 * Broken in v2.1.7, v2.1.6, and earlier. Fixed in versions > 2.1.7
